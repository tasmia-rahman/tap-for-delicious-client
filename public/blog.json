    "details": "Slaws are some of the best make-ahead salad recipes out there. Typically made with hearty vegetables like cabbage, kale, or broccoli, they’re sturdy enough to be dressed ahead of time. I like to accent the veggie base with a punchy dressing, herbs, and even fruit for maximum flavor. Make Summer Asian Slaw salad for your next picnic, and it’ll be a guaranteed hit. A tahini miso dressing gives it a creamy umami coating, while peaches add juicy pops of sweetness. I finish it with toasted pepitas for crunch \n You won’t miss the bacon in this lightened-up take on classic broccoli salad. Smoky roasted nuts take its place, adding delectable savory bites. A lightly creamy, sweet & tangy dressing takes the whole thing over the top. \n As soon as the temperature starts to dip in the fall, I look forward to making this salad. Made with just 7 ingredients, it’s a breeze to put together, but a bright lemon dressing, Parmesan cheese, pine nuts, and dried cranberries make it zippy, fresh, and satisfying.",
